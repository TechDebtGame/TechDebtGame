# TechDebt Game

## Overview
The **TechDebt Game** is a board game designed to enhance understanding and discussion of Technical Debt (TD) through an engaging and interactive simulation of the software development process. Players work in teams to develop a system while managing technical debt, facing real-world trade-offs between short-term gains and long-term maintainability. 

This game was developed as part of academic research and was designed to encourage discussions on software engineering concepts, particularly technical debt management.

## How It Works
- Two teams of two players compete within a predefined duration (e.g., 60 minutes).
- Each team builds a system consisting of three modules, completing **architecture** and **feature tickets**.
- Players can take on technical debt to speed up progress but will face increasing difficulties as the game progresses.
- The team with the most users (points) at the end of the game wins.
- Strategic elements include **event and action cards**, **debt repayment mechanics**, and **dependency management**.

## Game Components
- **Game Board** representing project progress and module placement.
- **Architecture & Feature Tickets** determining work and scoring.
- **Event Cards** with immediate negative consequences.
- **Action Cards** providing strategic advantages.
- **Dice** used to simulate work execution.
- **Technical Debt Mechanisms** influencing ticket completion and system stability.

## How to Play
For detailed rules, refer to the **[TechDebt Game Manual](./manual.md)**.
